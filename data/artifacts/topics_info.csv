called love me well with a title like that i don t know what to expect however after how to love turned out to be an awkward but slightly admirable ballad about a girl going through a hard life maybe a song titled love me would be a more personal number contemplating his personal struggles with trust and relationships and yeah it could just be another crappy bragging song but i like to be optimistic when i go into a review so what that s not the full title of the song what s the full title of the song drake bitches love me man i feel stupid well let s get this over with future i m on that good kush and alcohol stupid unnecessary audio watermark for the producer sneers i don t know what i was doing wait what was that thing she s wearing is that a stylized version of a scolds bridle a mild torture device that men put on women in the middle ages when they felt they were talking too much wow we ve wasted no time into getting into some pretty dark territory haven t we i mean you know what i haven t even started talking about the lyrics yet i m just gonna let this one go okay so this song which sounds more like a mockingbird type lullaby than a club hit is about being drunk and high and calling a couple girls to have sex and maybe these girls are just into really kinky stuff like you know headgear to remind them of a time when women were seen as even less inferior than we treat them now or swing sets yeah future imma ball til the day i fall one more thing before we continue when did this future character here a guy who barely passes as a rapper let alone a singer become credible enough in the industry to be featured chorus guy i mean according to what i m seeing on the lyric sheet he has no verse so without his own full verse the only appeal to having him on the song is purely based off of his ability to carry a hook and i m not sure if you ve noticed but future isn t exactly a powerhouse vocalist i mean could lil wayne honestly not be bothered to do the auto tune on his own hooks aren t you still friends with t pain at least that guy has some personality this guy is huh funny that a guy named future is relying on a vocal effect that s near extinction i mean when even t pain says t pain auto tune is on its way out back in i think it s over as a gimmick that people can take seriously but back to the song drake long as my bitches love my bitches love wait now drake is on the chorus is this the drake and future collaboration the world was waiting for he doesn t have a verse either so i can only assume that there was a large enough audience out there that would be oh so content enough to hear the musical style blending off the rapping personifications of both boring and uninteresting but forgive me again we need to get back to the song drake i can give a fuck bout no hater long as my bitches love me so the song is about how he doesn t care how many people dislike him as long as there are women willing to have sex with him which is typical but for some reason in this song he s more like an ineffective defense mechanism than cocky confident braggadocio actually listen to the song without the arrogant too cool to care faces in the music video and really listen to their voices future i m on that good kush and alcohol i got some down bitches i can call is there anything in his voice that indicates that he is in any way happy about his life of excess i mean if this was one of those songs where they were trying to make a statement about how empty that kind of life is that would be perfect but it s not and usually failings in the vocal melody can be excused by a beat that s full of vigor and but he can t do that here since every time the chorus comes in the beat gets that same muffled and muted effect that s present on nearly every friggin song featuring drake and since the vocalists are all you have to go on when this happens their lifeless delivery stops the song dead drake i can give a fuck bout no hater long as my bitches love me does he actually sound convinced here does he legitimately sound like he doesn t care about haters i don t know about you guys but to me it sounds like he s reverting to irrelevant boasting about superficial accomplishments intended to shield his ego after reading a scathing review of his music that sincerely struck a nerve all i hear is a couple of insecure men masking their weaknesses with boasts of sexual prowess and we haven t even gotten to the verses yet lil wayne pussy ass niggas stop hating so you don t care about haters in any way shape or form and only care about your women but the first thing you do in your verse is address the haters because you know what better way to show that you don t care about someone than by constantly mentioning them i don t know about you but there s something slightly contradictory about shouting hey all you haters pay attention to the fact that i don t care about you lil wayne lil tunechi got that fire and these hoes love me like satan man d do hoes like satan i mean i know hoes are known for having questionable morality but i don t think anyone actively likes satan i don t even think satanists likes satan they just do it to piss off christians i mean i know you re trying to relate the satan and fire thing but hoes don t like fire either lil wayne and these hoes love me like satan man you know believe it or not but some people think that this little snippet is proof positive that lil wayne is part of some demonic cult and honestly if you think some post production cgi inspired by a barely thought out lyric is the proof you need to think lil wayne works for the devil then he does work for the devil and he s going to kill you lil wayne fuck with me and get bodied and all she eat is dick she s on a strict diet you don t know how segways work do you i mean what thought process takes you from i m going to kill you to this chick is all about my penis for real the only piece of transitional material we get is the word and and i don t know about you but linking two phrases together with the word and is not the same as a transitional phrase and i like nipples lil wayne she don t want money she wants the time we could spend pfft yeah okay lose all your money to tax evasion and see if all your bitches still want to spend time with you lil wayne she said i never wanna make you mad i just wanna make you proud i said baby just make me cum then don t make a sound okay i m i m trying to explain what s wrong with these lines and what disturbs me about them because it s not just about the fact that they re objectifying the girl in question no that s to be expected with wayne but it s the fact that this couplet communicates something more unsettling than that and i just want to play these lyrics again and ask you a question lil wayne she said i never wanna make you mad i just wanna make you proud i said baby just make me cum then don t make a sound in what way does this not sound like an abusive relationship in what way is this not a controlling sociopath dominating over a woman who s afraid of giving him any excuse to lash out in anger at her i mean it s not overtly stating it but it s definitely implied wow that is not helping but anyway in his episode of behind the music he talked about how he freestyles everything because it feels more real to him and that everything he says honestly speaks to how his mind works because of that if this is true it says very disturbing things about him that he considers this as an honest expression of himself and you know what he s an artist and an artist telling you about his perspective doesn't always have to be a positive thing but my problem lies not in his questionable morals well actually yes it does but it s the fact that after so many girls hear his music and hear this song in particular plenty of his female fans are still willing to be his groupies in late night booty calls i mean he s making no bones about the fact that he doesn t respect you so at this point if you re still trying to get with him your motivations are probably no better than his and i think you know what i mean when i talk about the motivations of these types of women you know those women always wanting to spend all of your time lil wayne she wants the time we could spend scoff heartless succubus but hey maybe he s not that bad maybe when he s with these women he s actually respectful of the i m sorry are there women in cages like circus animals so let me get this straight lupe fiasco makes a song that barely charts talking about how women should not be purely viewed as sex objects and should hold themselves to a higher standard and he s accused of still bringing up patriarchal views on sexuality and all that stuff but lil wayne has a top hit with a music video where women are viewed as beasts in circus cages with lines like lil wayne i said baby just make me cum then don t make a sound and nobody s making a stink about this i m not saying it should be pulled off the air or anything i just think it s odd that a video with good intentions got crapped on while a video that can be easily interpreted as equating female sexuality with being entertained by animals is okay but where was i oh yes so like i was saying i m sure in real life wayne is very respectful to women lil wayne these hoes got pussies like craters damn that that imagery again to all the women still wanting to have sex with lil wayne this is what he metaphorically thinks of your vaginas picture of a crater so i think he s really trying to get across the point that he thinks you re all whores lil wayne can t treat these hoes like ladies man hey who do you treat like a lady because by acknowledging the idea of lady you re acknowledging that women can achieve a respectable status but none of the girls you ve ever met have achieved that status in your head so it s not that you re saying that all women are whores you re just saying that all women you refer to are whores hmm i wonder how that works for other things i m not saying that all chinese people are good at math play piano and know kung fu i m just saying that all the chinese people i m ever going to refer to are good at math play piano and know kung where s everybody going lil wayne pussy money weed codeine was that a lyric or just a reminder of all the topics he has to stick to lil wayne she wake up eat this dick call that breakfast in bed wait what do those last numbers have to do with anything are you saying that you and her are ing each other well that doesn t work since you only mention that she s going down on you and what is supposed to mean do you know why it s called wayne because the numbers vaguely resemble two people orally stimulating each other so what is supposed to represent two people facing away from each other what are they lying on each other s butts that makes no sense lil wayne i feel her heartbeat it s a little late to get romantic don t you think lil wayne i chest to chest with this bitch yeah i thought so lil wayne yeah all my bitches love me and i love all my bitches but it s like as soon as i cum i come to my senses hold on a minute maybe the song s trying to say something maybe this whole song is just trying to communicate that meaningless sex with random women doesn t actually lead to a fulfilling life and maybe eating less is a good way to get fiber in your diet of course there s no real revelation he just continues to talk about haters and hoes lil wayne now kiss my ass if you hatin i m getting ass or i m skating anything that keeps you from playing the guitar shows a scene of wayne playing the guitar live yeah keep hitting those two notes buddy i m sure the people who play the beginner mode on guitar hero are impressed yeah overall this gets a out of from me the melancholy beat sounds too dark to be a club song which is partially what ruins the atmosphere of it and the chorus fails to do anything that makes up for the dark tone of the beat and his rhymes are terrible there s no wordplay here that s clever enough to save him from being this unbearably sexist it crosses the line of being a regular sex anthem into a grotesque assertion of male dominance and ultimately does not make for a good listening experience and that s pretty much all i have to say about that well i m the rap critic you don t have to like my opinion but i don t have to like your song i don t know about you but there s something slightly contradictory about saying hey all you haters pay attention to the fact that i don t care about you chuckles""]"

thing i need to save me this loneliness will tear me apart i'm wishing myself back to the start cause when i'm holding i feel your heart and i hope it beats til it leads me back to where you are cause he's just not you and he's just not me like two strangers in the dark we've been trapped inside of a storyline where the pages lost their spark if i could break away could you say all the things you want to say oh darling could you wait for me cause maybe you're that thing i need and if i can follow through you'll find me standing right in front of you so tell me could you wait for me cause maybe
